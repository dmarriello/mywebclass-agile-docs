Task Title: Implement Progress Tracking System

User Story: As a user, I want to track my progress on completed educational resources, so that I can monitor my own professional development.

Description: Develop a progress tracking system for users to track their progress on completed educational resources. This will require designing and implementing a user interface for progress tracking and developing the backend functionality to store and retrieve progress data. The progress tracking system should allow users to see their progress across multiple categories, such as subject area, grade level, and topic. The progress tracking system should also allow users to view their progress over time.

Effort Estimate: 8 hours

Status: Not started

Notes: This task is dependent on the completion of the development of educational resources and the website's login system. The progress tracking system should be intuitive and easy to use for users of all skill levels.
