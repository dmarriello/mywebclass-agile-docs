Use consistent design and layout across all pages of the website to improve user experience

The task is to ensure that all pages on a website have a consistent design and layout in order to enhance the user experience. Consistency in design and layout helps users to navigate the website with ease, as they become familiar with the website's structure and the placement of elements. This task may involve ensuring that all pages have the same color scheme, typography, navigation menu, and footer. Additionally, it may require making sure that images and text are laid out consistently across all pages. The goal is to create a cohesive and visually appealing website that provides a seamless user experience. A consistent design and layout across all pages can also help to establish a brand identity and make the website more memorable to users.
