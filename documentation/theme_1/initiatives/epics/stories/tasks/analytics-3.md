Create custom reports to track user behavior on the website, such as page views, time spent on the site, and clicks

The task is to create custom reports that track user behavior on a website. Specifically, the reports should provide insights on page views, time spent on the site, and clicks made by users.

To accomplish this task, it may be necessary to use various analytics tools and software that can monitor user activity on the website. These tools can provide data on which pages are most frequently viewed, how long users spend on each page, and which links or buttons they click on.

Once the data is collected, custom reports can be generated that summarize the information in a meaningful way. These reports may include charts, graphs, or tables that make it easy to visualize and interpret the data. The reports can be used to identify patterns in user behavior, track changes over time, and identify areas where improvements can be made to the website to enhance the user experience.

Overall, creating custom reports to track user behavior on a website is an important task that can provide valuable insights for website owners and managers. By understanding how users interact with the site, it becomes easier to optimize content and design elements to improve user engagement and satisfaction.
