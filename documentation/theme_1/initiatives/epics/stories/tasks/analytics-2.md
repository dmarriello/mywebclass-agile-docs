Add the Google Analytics tracking code to the website

The task of adding the Google Analytics tracking code to a website involves integrating a small piece of JavaScript code into the website's source code to track user behavior and website traffic. The Google Analytics tracking code provides valuable insights into website visitors' demographics, location, behavior, and preferences, allowing website owners and administrators to make data-driven decisions and optimize their website's performance. The tracking code can be added to the website's header, footer, or individual pages, depending on the desired level of tracking granularity. Overall, adding Google Analytics tracking code is a crucial step for any website owner looking to gain a better understanding of their audience and improve their website's performance.
